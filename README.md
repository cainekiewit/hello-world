# hello-world
"hello-world" is my salute to all  the developers who have paved  the way and the developers who will continue to pave our ways.
I am a arachnomaniac, i hate my love for economics, I paint and my vocation is network developer.

I strive to make everything around me better than it was before I.

Je pense, donc je suis.

Cogito, ergo sum.
